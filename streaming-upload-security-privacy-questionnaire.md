- What information might this feature expose to Web sites or other parties, and for what purposes is that exposure necessary?
   - The feature provides an additional way to upload data to an HTTP server. No additional exposure is introduced.
- Is this specification exposing the minimum amount of information necessary to power the feature?
   - Same above. Regarding the amount of information, there is little difference between this feature and traditional uploading feature (uploading strings/arraybuffers/blobs with fetch()).
- How does this specification deal with personal information or personally-identifiable information or information derived thereof?
   - This feature doesn't interpret data it uploads. It is up to the application how to handle the data. This feature is usable only on HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, which means the data is always protected by encryption.
- How does this specification deal with sensitive information?
   - This feature doesn't interpret data it uploads. It is up to the application how to handle the data. This feature is usable only on HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, which means the data is always protected by encryption.
- Does this specification introduce new state for an origin that persists across browsing sessions?
   - No.
- What information from the underlying platform, e.g. configuration data, is exposed by this specification to an origin?

- Does this specification allow an origin access to sensors on a user’s device?
   - No.
- What data does this specification expose to an origin? Please also document what data is identical to data exposed by other features, in the same or different contexts.

   - None.

   - Behaviour is unchanged.
